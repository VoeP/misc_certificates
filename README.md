# Collection of miscellaneous certificates

I have found that doing short courses provided by organizations such as free code camp and kaggle is fairly fun and satisfying. I decided to display the certificates from the courses I have done here on my github page. 

The kaggle courses are quite short but well explained. The free code camp courses tend to be much longer with far more material and mandatory projects.
